## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an exciting and rapidly evolving field of computer science that focuses on building systems capable of intelligent behavior. From recognizing speech and images to translating languages and making complex decisions, AI systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Whether you're a student diving into AI for the first time or someone who's been around since the early days of computing, this course is designed to guide you through the core concepts and practical techniques in modern AI. We aim to make these topics accessible and engaging!

Throughout this series, you'll explore foundational models, mathematical formulas, and real world examples; from simple perceptrons to cutting-edge deep learning architectures like transformers. Each module is paired with hands-on coding exercises to help you reinforce what you learn and build your own intelligent systems. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of AI fundamentals and the tools to create and experiment with intelligent algorithms and applications.

## Table of Contents
This series covers the following topics, and you are encouraged to read the modules in order to build a strong foundation in the basics of AI.

## About
This educational series has been meticulously crafted to serve a diverse audience of learners, from those taking their very first steps into artificial intelligence to those with prior exposure seeking to deepen their understanding. The curriculum follows a carefully designed progression that builds foundational knowledge while gradually introducing more complex concepts.

For beginners, we've taken special care to explain concepts clearly with intuitive examples and visualizations that make abstract ideas concrete. Meanwhile, more experienced learners will find sufficient depth and advanced material to expand their knowledge boundaries. If you already possess familiarity with certain fundamental topics, you're encouraged to navigate directly to modules that challenge your current expertise level.

Developed at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) by faculty and researchers from the [College of Engineering](https://coe.gatech.edu/), this series represents our commitment to making high-quality AI education accessible to everyone, regardless of background or prior technical experience. The course materials reflect both cutting-edge research and time-tested pedagogical approaches refined in Georgia Tech's classrooms.

Our mission extends beyond merely teaching algorithms and techniques â€” we aim to democratize access to AI knowledge, foster critical thinking about AI's capabilities and limitations, and empower a new generation of innovators to apply these tools ethically and creatively. The interdisciplinary approach integrates perspectives from computer science, mathematics, engineering, and cognitive science to provide a comprehensive understanding of how artificial intelligence systems work and evolve.

We sincerely hope this learning journey proves valuable as you explore the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, whether your goals involve academic advancement, professional development, or personal enrichment! Your feedback is welcomed as we continuously strive to improve and expand these educational resources.
